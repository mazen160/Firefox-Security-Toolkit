It downloads the most important extensions, and install it on your browser. The used extensions has been chosen by a survey among the information security community. Based on it's results, *Firefox Security Toolkit* was made. Also, it allows you to download Burp Suite certificate and a large user-agent list for User-Agent Switcher. Making it one-click away to prepare your web-application testing browser.

###How does it differs from well-known projects, such as *OWASP Mantra* and *Hcon STF*?
*OWASP Mantra* and *Hcon STF* are not regularly updated, and needs a lot of work in order to develop and maintain. Meanwhile, *Firefox Security Toolkit* does not need a additional maintaining, although I would be maintaining it for any issues/bugs if needed. The used extensions are downloaded from Mozilla Addons Store with its latest version, to ensure the best testing experience for the penetration tester.
